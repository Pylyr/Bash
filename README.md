# Bash
There are multiple files from various projects like: \n
Games, Prime generating algorithms, Poker, etc. \n
There is also S-Terminal which is a list of functions which simplify my daily life when using Terminal \n
It has some cool features like: /rain; /weather; /stopwatch... \n
Bascially, small scipts which I joined in one and they are all available in terminal prompt. \n
