# Bash
 There are multiple files from various projects like: 
 Games, Prime generating algorithms, Poker, etc. 
 There is also S-Terminal which is a list of functions which simplify my daily life when using Terminal 
 It has some cool features like: /rain; /weather; /stopwatch... 
 Bascially, small scipts which I joined in one and they are all available in terminal prompt.
